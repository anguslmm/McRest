# McRest
#### Just a silly test REST API for me to solve coding problems on

This project is a REST API that I'll be using to experiment with implementing solutions to harder programming challenges. Eventually, I'll also implement an Angular 4 interface to use with the API.

In addition to that actual, normal REST API, there will also be business endpoints that do more than just CRUD.
